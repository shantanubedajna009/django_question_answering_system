made a loose matcching for it

for example matches with all words in questions

if extra words prsents then it will return all maching with those words


since no dungeons and dragons are present it only returned one correct result

but what , is , etc are present in almost all question so it generalized it

and returned all matching




a dropdown can be implemented where when you start writing question
it auto predits like google so you only search with coirrect question



no areopplanes and flying bisons  are present so it returned motto matching



and this is ON TOP OF WHAT ALREADY IS

THIS FUNCTIONALITY ONLY GETS EXECUTED IF SOMEBODY WRITES WORDS NOT PRESENT IN QUESTION ITSELF
